      <description>Rather than focusing on building a single-domain task solver, Omicron agents provide developers with a core agent architecture that supports integration with third-party task solvers through Mechanisms. The core architecture is composed of an Agent class, a memory graph called Omnigraph, an Agenda and AgendaProcessor, and Mechanisms which are categorized into InputMechanisms, OutputMechanisms, and InternalMechanisms.</description>
